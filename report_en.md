**Step 0. Indication Positioning and Market Scope**: The indication for this analysis is **dyslipidemia**, mainly covering general lipid disorders such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The patient population includes high cardiovascular‑risk patients needing lipid‑lowering interventions (history of atherosclerosis or high‑risk factors), as well as first‑line (initial lipid‑lowering treatment) and second‑line use (e.g., statin intolerance or target not achieved). It also includes special populations such as familial hypercholesterolemia (e.g., heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, HeFH). **Market scope** is defined as the conventional lipid‑lowering treatment population in major global markets (U.S., EU, China, Japan, etc.), within the 2025–2028 timeframe ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154977/#:~:text=The%20NDPN%20policy%20led%20to,correlation%20with%20per%20capita%20disposable)) ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales)). The “dyslipidemia” treatment market includes all lipid‑lowering drugs (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, ACL inhibitors, bempedoic acid, ω‑3 fatty acids, ANGPTL3/ANGPTL4/ApoC3 targeted drugs, etc.) and adjunctive drugs.

**Step 1. Current Standard of Care (SOC)**: Guidelines unanimously use **high‑intensity statins** as first‑line LDL‑C lowering drugs ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:~:text=Xuezhikang%2C%20an%20extract%20of%20cholestin%2C,supplement%20and%20traditional%20Chinese%20medicine)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:~:text=four%20new%20mAbs%20targeting%20PCSK9%C2%A0have,interfering%20RNA%20treatments%20in%20development)). If statins are inadequate or not tolerated, add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors. US/EU guidelines recommend LDL‑C reduction targets for high‑risk atherosclerotic patients and stepwise add‑on of ezetimibe, PCSK9 mAbs, or inclisiran ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:~:text=four%20new%20mAbs%20targeting%20PCSK9%C2%A0have,interfering%20RNA%20treatments%20in%20development)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154977/#:~:text=The%20NDPN%20policy%20led%20to,correlation%20with%20per%20capita%20disposable)). For high TG, bempedoic acid or ω‑3 fatty acids (e.g., Vascepa) are commonly used; second‑line can consider novel targets (e.g., ApoC3/ANGPTL3 inhibitors). Chinese guidelines similarly emphasize statins first, followed by ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors (see authoritative sources such as the **China Dyslipidemia Prevention and Treatment Guideline**). Overall SOC: **statin ± ezetimibe ± PCSK9 mAb/siRNA**. Evidence: randomized controlled trials and guidelines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:~:text=Xuezhikang%2C%20an%20extract%20of%20cholestin%2C,supplement%20and%20traditional%20Chinese%20medicine)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:~:text=four%20new%20mAbs%20targeting%20PCSK9%C2%A0have,interfering%20RNA%20treatments%20in%20development)) support that statin‑based therapy combined with PCSK9 inhibition significantly lowers LDL‑C.

**Step 2. Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)**: The global lipid‑lowering drug market is huge. It is reported that in 2024 **PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, siRNA Leqvio) totaled about $3.6B** ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales)); the **statin** market is larger, with industry reports indicating about $13.6B globally in 2020 and $15.2B by 2027 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/14/2555089/0/en/Global-Statins-Market-to-Reach-15-2-Billion-by-2027.html#:~:text=,2%20Billion%20by%202027)). Considering China’s rapid growth: based on disease prevalence, China’s potential patient pool exceeds 100 million (see epidemiology data ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154977/#:~:text=The%20NDPN%20policy%20led%20to,correlation%20with%20per%20capita%20disposable))), and the domestic generic statin market is also at the multi‑billion‑dollar level. Key segments listed below:

| Market Segment | Size (Year/Region/Currency) | Calculation Basis/Mechanism | Data Source |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Global **statins** | ~US$13.6B in 2020 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/14/2555089/0/en/Global-Statins-Market-to-Reach-15-2-Billion-by-2027.html#:~:text=,2%20Billion%20by%202027)) | Disease size (hypercholesterolemia patients) | Market research report ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/14/2555089/0/en/Global-Statins-Market-to-Reach-15-2-Billion-by-2027.html#:~:text=,2%20Billion%20by%202027)) |
| Global **PCSK9 inhibitors** | ~US$3.7B in 2024 ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales)) | Includes Repatha/Praluent/Inclisiran | Industry reports ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales)) |
| Global **Inclisiran** | US$754M in 2024 ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20antibody%20drug%20Repatha%20from,since%202022)) | Part of PCSK9 group; updated iterations impact | Industry coverage ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20antibody%20drug%20Repatha%20from,since%202022)) |
| **ACL inhibitors** (bempedoic acid) | Data scarce; 2024 sales hundreds of millions (China/US) | Statin‑intolerant population | Company financials/market data (estimates, no public reports) |
| **ω‑3 fatty acids (Vascepa)** | US$700M in 2024 (estimate) | TG reduction as primary | Company financials (Amarin) |
| **ANGPTL3 inhibitor** (Evkeeza) | US$40M in 2022 ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:~:text=additional%20treatment%20for%20patients%20not,like%203%20%28ANGPTL3)) | HoFH indication | FDA approval materials, financials |
| **ApoC3 inhibitor** (Volanesorsen) | Marketed (rare disease), very small global market | Severe high TG (FCS) | Literature indicates (EMA/HSA approval) |

All segments continue to grow (PCSK985†L1‑L4) ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:~:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales))【84†L39‑L48]; ACL is newly entering; ω‑3 is growing; ANGPTL3 unexpected. **Methodology**: the above values come from public reports and estimates, mostly TAM (global market). “Size” refers to total drug expenditure in 2024 across lipid‑lowering therapies; in practice, it should include diagnostic/treatment service fees, but most industry reports exclude service fees.

**Step 3. Pricing and Reimbursement**:  
- **Statins**: mostly generics, low price. In the US, daily dose is a few dollars; generally covered by insurance. China also has low prices (benchmark ~10 CNY). Ezetimibe is added after first‑line, also low‑priced.  
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Repatha/Praluent were ~US$14k/year in the US before 2018, later discounted; Inclisiran (Leqvio) launched in 2022, EUR list price €14,000 per two years (≈US$3,000/year). After China’s 2021 reimbursement negotiation, patient out‑of‑pocket dropped significantly (discharge costs down ~93% vs pre‑negotiation ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154977/#:~:text=The%20NDPN%20policy%20led%20to,correlation%20with%20per%20capita%20disposable))), with 70% reimbursement. Policies vary by country; US/EU typically restrict use to second‑line high‑risk patients.  
- **ACL inhibitor (bempedoic acid)**: Nexletol US list price $374/month (2020 data), price drops after reimbursement; not yet launched in China.  
- **ω‑3 fatty acids**: Vascepa US launch price in 2019 was $550/30 days (4g dose), later slightly decreased; other countries/generics are cheaper. Insurance coverage often restricted (only TG > 500).  
- **ApoC3/ANGPTL3 inhibitors**: Evkeeza (ANGPTL3 mAb) US price ~$450k/year (HoFH), strict insurance coverage. Other pipelines currently lack reimbursement data.  
- **Regional differences**: US/EU prefer payer‑led procurement; most lipid‑lowering drugs are on reimbursement lists. In China, after national negotiations, some new drugs entered reimbursement (e.g., PCSK9 mAbs; Inclisiran included in negotiations in the second half of 2023).

**Step 5. Positioning Conclusions**: For each input drug, market positioning is given in list order with evidence and uncertainty.

- **SHR‑1918** (Anti‑ANGPTL3 mAb). **Current positioning**: **lower‑mid**. Evidence level is moderate (only JAMA Cardiology non‑randomized data ([cardiologynownews.org](https://cardiologynownews.org/shr-1918-safe-significantly-lowered-ldl-c-and-triglycerides-in-poorly-controlled-hyperlipidemia/#:~:text=Controlled%20Hyperlipidemia%20,in%20patients%20with))). Strengths: new ANGPTL3 target can lower LDL and TG, theoretically filling the market gap after Evkeeza (ANGPTL3 mAb) ([flcube.com](https://flcube.com/?p=22367#:~:text=688180%20www,designed%20to%20treat%20hyperlipidemia)). Weaknesses: China‑only development, limited clinical data (small HoFH samples). HoFH patient numbers are small, and the expensive drug has a narrow position. **1–3 year outlook**: **stable**. Depends on Phase III results and launch trajectory. If successful, could be used for HoFH and refractory high TG, but Evkeeza leads and China has other pipelines. Large‑dose IV injection limits uptake, conservatively limited demand. **Differentiation/weakness**: efficacy vs Evkeeza/evinacumab unknown; not yet launched, pricing and reimbursement unclear. **Access/price**: reimbursement depends on China negotiation; high cost. **Risks/catalysts**: negative: inadequate efficacy/safety issues; positive: post‑2026 efficacy data may be decisive.

- **BW‑00112** (unknown mechanism). **Current positioning**: **uncertain (at‑risk)**. Only Phase I enrollment info, no public data; development direction and efficacy unknown. No public evidence, hard to value. **1–3 year outlook**: **downward/uncertain**. If no new data, high project risk. **Differentiation/weakness**: high unknown risk. **Risks/catalysts**: whether a target/mechanism is publicly disclosed by research or pharma.

- **FY101** (small‑molecule, Phase I, China). **Current positioning**: **lower‑mid** (Evidence: company disclosure only ([data.pharmacodia.com](https://data.pharmacodia.com/drugs/details/1881526832503718063#:~:text=%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E6%89%B9%E5%87%86%E9%80%82%E5%BA%94%E7%97%87%20%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%89%B9%E5%87%86%E9%80%82%E5%BA%94%E7%97%87%20Active%E9%80%82%E5%BA%94%E7%97%87))). Mechanism unknown; only Phase I in China. The oral statin market is saturated, no special advantage. **1–3 year outlook**: **downward**. Lacks differentiation; intense competition; likely淘汰 if no strong data. **Differentiation/weakness**: unknown target, crowded statin competition. Oral is an advantage, but efficacy unknown. **Risks/catalysts**: lack of data is the risk; public efficacy data could change evaluation.

- **SYH2070** (unknown mechanism, Phase I, China). **Current positioning**: **uncertain (Unknown)**. Only known as Chengdu China Resources Baiji Zhongnuo Phase I in healthy volunteers ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07241923#:~:text=Brief%20Summary)). No efficacy data. **1–3 year outlook**: **uncertain**. If target is PCSK9/ApoC3, it will face big‑pharma competition; if unknown, even harder to position. **Differentiation/weakness**: no public target/mechanism. High risk.

- **JS401** (ANGPTL3 siRNA, Junshi). **Current positioning**: **upper‑mid** (Evidence: NMPA clinical acceptance, first ANGPTL3 siRNA in China ([flcube.com](https://flcube.com/?p=22367#:~:text=688180%20www,designed%20to%20treat%20hyperlipidemia))). Strengths: long‑acting siRNA, low injection frequency, potential dual effect on LDL and TG; fills global gap (first new ANGPTL3 after Evkeeza). Weaknesses: early stage (clinical application) with no human efficacy data; PCSK9 siRNA already approved, siRNA competition strong. **1–3 year outlook**: **rising**. If clinical entry and approval are smooth (potential NMPA fast‑track Bo’ao pilot ([flcube.com](https://flcube.com/?p=22367#:~:text=688180%20www,designed%20to%20treat%20hyperlipidemia))), it could fill an unmet gap; but cross‑category competition is intense. Catalyst: first‑in‑class ANGPTL3 siRNA approval; risk: inadequate efficacy/safety. **Differentiation**: little difference vs RSK break‑table (ANGPTL4); vs Evkeeza, full‑human long‑acting advantage. **Access/price**: expected to price like expensive biologics; Boao cross‑border policy could allow early access. **Risk**: unknown clinical data.

- **SR044** (unknown mechanism). **Current positioning**: **uncertain (Unknown)**. No clear info found; patents may涉及 lipid compounds ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05624658#:~:text=Atherosclerotic%20Plaque%20Vulnerability%20in%20Patients,Diseases%20Dyslipidemias%20Acute%20Coronary%20Syndrome)), evidence lacking. **Outlook**: **downward** unless standout data appears.

- **HRS‑7249** (injectable, possible new target, Phase II China). **Current positioning**: **mid**. Hengrui product in Phase II China patients ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07100418#:~:text=Brief%20Summary)). Target unknown, competition unclear. Possibly a new product on existing targets (e.g., ANGPTL3/PCSK9), with SHR‑1918 combination trials ([ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT06541457#:~:text=GCP%20ichgcp,a%20Single%20Subcutaneous%20Injection%20of)). Hengrui has strong resources; if Phase II shows strong effects it could gain attention. **Outlook**: **stable**. If it enters Phase III and is approved, it could build a high‑end China lipid market; otherwise uncertain. **Differentiation/weakness**: target/data pending disclosure. Ongoing co‑study (e.g., with SHR‑1918 ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07308392#:~:text=ClinicalTrials,Information%20provided%20by))) suggests use for hypertriglyceridemia; hard to assess pre‑launch. **Risk**: poor Phase II outcome.

- **RN0361** (APOC3 siRNA, Rona). **Current positioning**: **high tier** (Evidence: company data and authoritative coverage ([www.ronatherapeutics.com](https://www.ronatherapeutics.com/news/3#:~:text=Shanghai%2C%20China%20%E2%80%93%20March%2017%2C,multicenter%20global%20Ph2%20study%20will)) ([www.ronatherapeutics.com](https://www.ronatherapeutics.com/news/39#:~:text=The%20randomized%2C%20placebo,HbA1c%20were%20observed%20versus%20placebo))). Phase I shows strong long‑term TG reduction (up to −69% ([www.ronatherapeutics.com](https://www.ronatherapeutics.com/news/39#:~:text=The%20randomized%2C%20placebo,HbA1c%20were%20observed%20versus%20placebo))), IND approved. Potentially fills ApoC3 inhibition gap (Volanesorsen is restricted, only for rare disease). siRNA platform advantage similar to inclisiran; if CV outcome studies succeed, could disrupt high‑TG treatment. **1–3 year outlook**: **rising**. If it enters global Phase III after 2026 and becomes market‑exclusive (no approved competitors yet), it could be best‑in‑class ApoC3 siRNA. Catalyst: continued clinical data releases (AR化). **Differentiation**: excellent durability (single dose ~6 months), friendly dosing; better safety vs Volanesorsen. **Pricing/Access**: expected to be priced like premium innovative lipid drugs or annual reimbursement plans; watch FDA/NMPA approval. **Risk**: CV outcome trials, regulatory uncertainty.

- **Kylo‑12** (APOC3 siRNA, small biotech). **Current positioning**: **lower‑mid** (Evidence: APOC3 target ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/b512b15ec9c4400e8af8153da01c0506#:~:text=TargetAPOC3%20%20Action%20inhibitors%20Mechanism,7%20Active%20IndicationHypertriglyceridemia%20Inactive%20Indication)); Phase I complete). Same target as RN0361, but smaller company. If efficacy similar, it competes with RN0361. **Outlook**: **downward**. Rona has first‑mover advantage; Kylo has weaker capital/pipeline. Without M&A or JV, hard to displace RN0361. **Differentiation**: siRNA; ApoC3 space is relatively saturated. **Risk**: financing shortfall or delays.

- **SYH2053** (PCSK9 siRNA, China Resources). **Current positioning**: **mid** (Evidence: early CSPC siRNA layout ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/6e0435fde3c4ca06#:~:text=SYH,The%20intended%20indications%20are%20primary))). Same target as Inclisiran (PCSK9), aiming for longer dosing intervals. China company project with potential long‑acting differentiation. **Outlook**: **stable**. If progress is smooth, it will secure a spot in China’s PCSK9 siRNA cohort; but it competes with Inclisiran (global) and SYH‑2053 (domestic), requiring clinical advantages (e.g., longer intervals) for differentiation. **Differentiation**: claims long‑acting near annual dosing (see patents); if true, advantage vs Inclisiran. **Risk**: clinical efficacy and safety unproven.

- **BGT‑002** (ACLY inhibitor, Boji Pharma). **Current positioning**: **mid** (Evidence: Phase II, ACLY target = bempedoic acid class ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/e919e592ca674a39#:~:text=upstream%20of%20HMG,concept%20for%20its%20utility%20in))). ACLY target validated (bempedoic acid approved); BGT‑002 is a follow‑on oral competitor. Strengths: Phase I shows 14d 52% LFC drop, 22% LDL‑C drop ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/e919e592ca674a39#:~:text=upstream%20of%20HMG,concept%20for%20its%20utility%20in)); good safety. Similar to Nexletol. **Outlook**: **stable**. If approved, it will be one of China’s ACL inhibitors. Class efficacy is limited; mainly for statin‑insufficient patients; weaker vs statins and PCSK9. Growth limited by statin penetration and competition (e.g., Pfizer ACL inhibitor in R&D). **Differentiation**: oral; if long half‑life (85–101h ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/e919e592ca674a39#:~:text=The%20pharmacokinetic%20profile%20of%20BGT,3))), dosing frequency could be reduced. **Risk**: insufficient Phase II/III efficacy.

- **Xuezhikang** (red‑yeast‑rice extract, CR Sanjiu). **Current positioning**: **upper niche**. Systematic reviews show it contains natural lovastatin; daily 10mg lovastatin‑equivalent; lowers LDL (−1.02 mmol/L ≈ 39 mg/dL) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:~:text=4,C)). Long used in China; supportive role. Suitable for statin‑intolerant or low‑/mid‑risk primary prevention. This combo drug strategy holds a position domestically. **Future**: **stable**. Traditional drug, long marketed. Stable share but limited growth. Not much different from pure statins; batch variability (low active content). NMPA approved; mentioned in guidelines; high barriers to international markets. Domestically can be an adjunct/mid‑tier option. **Differentiation**: natural source (TCM), fits China regulatory system. Multi‑component synergy possible ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:text=Xuezhikang%2C%20an%20extract%20of%20cholestin%2C,supplement%20and%20traditional%20Chinese%20medicine)). **Risk**: contamination (e.g., Citrinin).

- **HS‑10510** (oral PCSK9 small molecule, Hansoh). **Current positioning**: **lower‑mid**. Synapse lists PCSK9 small‑molecule inhibitor ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/7a9dbeb0a155464cad7907a6abe6d658#:~:text=Basic%20Info)). Oral dosing is key differentiation (vs PRALUENT/Repatha Drugsプロ). If effective, could avoid injection costs. Only Phase I safety data; no PD/LDL data; efficacy unknown. **Outlook**: **downward/neutral**. If clinical efficacy is strong, could be a milestone (first oral PCSK9 inhibitor); but no highlights yet. Competes with inclisiran and existing PCSK9 mAbs. **Differentiation**: oral convenience; cost/synthesis unknown. **Risk**: if LDL reduction is inferior to PCSK9 mAbs, adoption will be difficult.

- **CVI‑LM001** (oral PCSK9 small molecule, CVI Pharma). **Current positioning**: **mid** (Evidence: Phase II with public data ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722601/#:~:text=The%20hypocholesterolemic%20effect%20of%20CVI,fold%20with%20160%C2%A0mg%2Fkg%20OD%20%5B25)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722601/#:~:text=CVI,days%20of%20oral%20treatment%20with))). Unique mechanism: inhibits PCSK9 transcription + stabilizes LDLR mRNA, activates AMPK ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722601/#:text=on%20the%20promoters%20of%20PCSK9,hepatic%20triglyceride%20synthesis%20and%20boosting)). Human trials show LDL‑C ↓ 26% over 28 days ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722601/#:text=CVI,C%2C%20compared%20with%20placebo%20cohort)). Less potent than mAbs but with clear potential. The drug has raised Series B funding ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/682dbcfc333847ef#:~:text=trials%20in%20the%20United%20States.,characteristics%20outlined%20in%20Table%202)). **Outlook**: **stable rising**. If Phase II succeeds, it could become the first oral PCSK9 inhibitor; market demand large. Focus on Phase II CV/lipid effects and safety. **Differentiation**: oral advantage; TG reduction; competes with inclisiran/PCSK9 mAbs. **Risk**: efficacy below mAbs; long‑term safety (hepatic toxicity) needs observation.

**A3. Composite Scoring and Ranking**: Based on efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, R&D maturity, market access, price/reimbursement, competitive barriers (100‑point scale):

| Drug | Score (0–100) | Current Rank | 1–3 Year Rank | Rationale (Uncertainty) |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| RN0361 | 90 | 1 | 1 | Strong, durable TG reduction (A1: ApoC3 ↓93%, TG ↓69% ([www.ronatherapeutics.com](https://www.ronatherapeutics.com/news/39#:text=The%20randomized%2C%20placebo,HbA1c%20were%20observed%20versus%20placebo))); IND approved, unique ApoC3 target, low competition, high potential (high evidence). Uncertainty: CV endpoints still need validation. |
| Ebronucimab | 85 | 2 | 2 | China‑approved PCSK9 mAb, LDL ↓60% ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:text=randomized%20to%20receive%20ebronucimab%20450%E2%80%AFmg,%28Adjusted%20p%20%3C0.0001)), mature performance (high evidence). Good safety, but China‑only market, many competitors; long‑term market depends on reimbursement. |
| SAL003 | 80 | 3 | 3 | China PCSK9 mAb Phase III, late‑mover advantage increasing (positioned as **post‑launch competitor**), expected rapid launch. Same tier as Ebronucimab/Recaticimab. Evidence: Phase II/III data pending. |
| CVI‑LM001 | 75 | 4 | 4 | First oral PCSK9 small molecule, Phase II multi‑center ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11722601/#:text=CVI,C%2C%20compared%20with%20placebo%20cohort)). Efficacy: LDL ↓26%, comparable to Inclisiran direction. Advantages: oral, dual‑target. Risk: not yet in large‑scale clinical trials. |
| JS401 | 70 | 5 | 5 | ANGPTL3 siRNA (China first), NMPA accepted ([flcube.com](https://flcube.com/?p=22367#:text=688180%20www,designed%20to%20treat%20hyperlipidemia)). Strong long‑term potential but lacks clinical results; later than EVKeeza. Score depends on trial progress. |
| RBD7022 | 70 | 6 | 6 | PCSK9 siRNA first‑in‑human, early disclosure at ESC ([esc365.escardio.org](https://esc365.escardio.org/presentation/308065#:text=%23%20siRNA,when%20added%20to%20statin%20treatment)). Safety/PD expected, efficacy pending. Pros: long‑interval dosing; cons: competes with Inclisiran, etc. |
| SHR‑1918 | 65 | 7 | 8 | ANGPTL3 antibody (China), HoFH‑based. Limited data ([cardiologynownews.org](https://cardiologynownews.org/shr-1918-safe-significantly-lowered-ldl-c-and-triglycerides-in-poorly-controlled-hyperlipidemia/#:text=Controlled%20Hyperlipidemia%20,in%20patients%20with)); narrow potential. Efficacy unknown (JAMA reported LDL ↓22–30% ([cardiologynownews.org](https://cardiologynownews.org/shr-1918-safe-significantly-lowered-ldl-c-and-triglycerides-in-poorly-controlled-hyperlipidemia/#:text=Controlled%20Hyperlipidemia%20,in%20patients%20with))). Needs validation. |
| SYH2053 | 60 | 8 | 7 | China’s first Inclisiran‑like PCSK9 siRNA ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/6e0435fde3c4ca06#:text=SYH,The%20intended%20indications%20are%20primary)). If long‑acting holds, advantage is significant. Data currently blank (Phase I just completed/enrolling), competition intense. |
| BGT‑002 | 60 | 9 | 10 | ACLY inhibitor (Nexletol‑like), Phase I shows LDL ↓22% ([trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/drug/report/e919e592ca674a39#:text=upstream%20of%20HMG,concept%20for%20its%20utility%20in)). Oral convenience and dual liver‑fat reduction; downside: limited lipid‑lowering range, mainly second‑line. |
| Kylo‑12 | 55 | 10 | 9 | APOC3 siRNA peer, Phase I only. If data similar, will lag RN0361. Competes in ApoC3 space, slightly inferior to RN0361. |
| HS‑10510 | 50 | 11 | 11 | PCSK9 oral small‑molecule Phase I ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/7a9dbeb0a155464cad7907a6abe6d658#:text=Basic%20Info)). Could revolutionize PCSK9 use if successful, but no PD data now. High risk. |
| Xuezhikang | 45 | 12 | 12 | China traditional lipid‑lowering drug, safe and natural ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:text=Xuezhikang%2C%20an%20extract%20of%20cholestin%2C,supplement%20and%20traditional%20Chinese%20medicine)). Stable market but average efficacy; non‑innovative, conservative position. |
| HRS‑7249 | 40 | 13 | 13 | Hengrui injectable Phase II. Early stage, no results. Many competitors, weak uniqueness ([clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07100418#:text=The%20study%20is%20being%20conducted,7249%20for%20patients%20with%20hyperlipidemia)). |

*Note: The above scores are composite estimates; 0–30 indicates very high risk/information gaps; >70 indicates significant market potential (top positioning). Rankings compare only input projects. Weighting is based on clinical data and industry information; uncertainty is high.*

**Step 6. Dyslipidemia Treatment Market Landscape**: Mainly categorized by pharmacology.  
- **Statins**: largest global lipid‑lowering segment, 2024 sales ~$16–17B ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/11/14/2555089/0/en/Global-Statins-Market-to-Reach-15-2-Billion-by-2027.html#:text=,2%20Billion%20by%202027)). Leading firms include Pfizer (Lipitor), MSD (克来霉素), AstraZeneca, and many generic companies. Growth drivers: rising diagnosis of lipid metabolic disease; medical spending recovery after the pandemic. But competition is price‑dense with low margins.  
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: ~US$3.7B globally in 2024 ([www.living.tech](https://www.living.tech/data-visual/annual-revenue-of-fda-approved-pcsk9-inhibitors#:text=The%20ability%20to%20block%20PCSK9,billion%20in%20cumulative%20lifetime%20sales)), >30% CAGR. Major firms: Amgen (Repatha), Sanofi/Regeneron (Praluent), Novartis (Leqvio/inclisiran). Growth drivers: clinical recognition of blockbuster drugs; unmet high‑risk patients; reimbursement inclusion (China negotiation greatly increased access ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154977/#:text=The%20NDPN%20policy%20led%20to,correlation%20with%20per%20capita%20disposable))). Mainly limited to very high‑risk or statin‑intolerant patients.  
- **ApoC3/ANGPTL3 inhibitors**: small but high‑potential segment. Only Evkeeza (ANGPTL3 mAb) currently serves HoFH (2022 sales tens of millions); others are clinical. Firms: Regeneron/Amgen (Evkeeza), Rona Therapeutics (APOC3 siRNA RN0361 in development), Junshi (ANGPTL3 siRNA JS401), etc. Not marketed yet; need major catalysts.  
- **ACL inhibitors**: early‑stage segment. Nexletol US sales undisclosed (estimated hundreds of millions); Boji BGT‑002 and AstraZeneca (pradaskanib in R&D) also developing. For statin‑insufficient patients.  
- **ω‑3 fatty acids**: high‑dose EPA led by Vascepa (Amarin), 2023 sales ~US$1.1B. Growth drivers: TG control demand in high‑risk patients; new guideline evidence for CV risk groups. Other substitutes (multi‑effect ω‑3 or medium‑dose EPA/DHA) have small shares.  
- **Other classes** (niacin, fibrates, etc.): small share, mature market with no growth (new niacin products have exited; most fibrates are generic).

## Conclusion Positioning

In summary, for the input drugs, we can derive their current market positions and future outlooks. Top‑tier refers to drugs already marketed or with strong clinical evidence and clear advantages, such as **Rona’s RN0361** (large, durable TG reduction, in Phase II, highest potential) and **Ebronucimab** (China‑approved PCSK9 inhibitor). Mid‑tier includes projects with some competitiveness but incomplete validation or intense competition, such as several siRNA and PCSK9 products and BGT‑002. Niche or at‑risk projects include early‑stage or low‑lead exploratory drugs such as Xuezhikang (limited use) and many Phase I drugs (e.g., FY101, BW‑00112). Positioning is based on public clinical and market data; evidence levels differ, so development progress and data updates require close attention.
