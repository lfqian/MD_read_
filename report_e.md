**Part A: Market Position One-pager**  

**Indication & Market Boundary (Step 0):** Dyslipidemia refers to abnormal lipid levels (predominantly elevated LDL‐cholesterol or triglycerides) in adults, managed to reduce atherosclerotic CVD risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690187/#:~:text=,1.8%20mmol%2FL%29.%20A)).  The population includes adults at moderate or high CVD risk (primary prevention) and those with established ASCVD (secondary prevention) or genetic dyslipidemias (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=)).  We consider all approved lipid‐lowering therapies (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors/siRNA, omega-3, bempedoic acid, etc.) for market sizing globally.  Exclude experimental unapproved compounds and “lifestyle changes” (diet/exercise only).  

**Standard of Care (Step 1):**  In most guidelines, maximally tolerated statin therapy is first-line for all patients with dyslipidemia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)).  High-intensity statins are indicated for secondary prevention (ASCVD or diabetes with CVD risk ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690187/#:~:text=,1.8%20mmol%2FL%29.%20A))) and may be considered in primary prevention of intermediate/high-risk patients ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690187/#:~:text=,1.8%20mmol%2FL%29.%20A)).  If LDL-C remains above goal, add‐on therapy is recommended: ezetimibe (as per IMPROVE-IT) is standard second-line ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=)) (reduces LDL by ~20% on top of statin).  In very high-risk or statin/FH patients, PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) are added ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=)) (~60% LDL drop in trials ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=))).  Bempedoic acid (ACLY inhibitor) is now guideline-endorsed for statin-intolerant patients (CLEAR Outcomes showed ↓CV events, ~13% vs placebo ([www.escardio.org](https://www.escardio.org/communities/councils/cardiology-practice/education/cardiopractice/bempedoic-acid-mechanism-evidence-safety-and-guideline-role-in-2025/#:~:text=trial,intensity%20statin%20in%20those))).  Icosapent ethyl (omega-3 EPA) is used for high-TG/high-risk patients (REDUCE-IT trial benefit ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=))). Fibrates, niacin and fish-oil supplements have marginal roles (no new RCT support) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20new%20recommendations,since%20the%202016%20CCS%20guidelines)).  Lifestyle (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) is foundational ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=The%202021%20CCS%20dyslipidemia%20guidelines,reinforce%20the%20following%20lifestyle%20modifications)).

**Market Size (Step 2):**  The global lipid‐lowering market is on the order of **tens of billions USD**.  One estimate puts the global dyslipidemia drug market at ~$33–34B (mid-2020s) ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lipid-lowering-drugs-market-size-to-surpass-usd-46-58-bn-by-2033#:~:text=The%20global%20lipid,to%20drive%20the%20growth%20of)) ([www.industryresearch.biz](https://www.industryresearch.biz/market-reports/dyslipidemia-drugs-market-112967#:~:text=Dyslipidemia%20Drugs%20Market%20size%20valued,44)).  Key segments include **statins** and **PCSK9 inhibitors**: globals statin sales were estimated ~$16.8B in 2024 ([www.databridgemarketresearch.com](https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-statin-market#:~:text=Statin%20Market%20Size%2C%20Trends%2C%20Growth,During%20the)), while PCSK9 inhibitors (mAbs + inclisiran) were about $2.9B in 2024 ([www.cognitivemarketresearch.com](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/pcsk9-inhibitors-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20PCSK9%20Inhibitors%20market,It%20will)).  Other segments: icosapent ethyl ~$1.5B (2024) (growing after REDUCE-IT).  We define TAM as all prescription lipid therapies (global, 2025, USD).  (Some numbers from market reports; e.g. $34.3B global in 2024 ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lipid-lowering-drugs-market-size-to-surpass-usd-46-58-bn-by-2033#:~:text=The%20global%20lipid,to%20drive%20the%20growth%20of))).

**Pricing & Access (Step 3):**  Generic statins are inexpensive (e.g. atorvastatin ~\$4 for a 30-tablet, 40mg supply ([www.goodrx.com](https://www.goodrx.com/atorvastatin#:~:text=%244))) and universally reimbursed.  Branded add-ons are costly: PCSK9 mAbs were launched ~\$585 per 140mg dose (~\$4,200/year) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=)), and inclisiran WAC ~\$3,250/dose (\$6,500/yr) ([www.tctmd.com](https://www.tctmd.com/news/pricey-inclisiran-rolling-out-buy-and-bill-model-may-smooth-its-path#:~:text=the%20wholesale%20acquisition%20cost%20,of%20the%20drug%20remain%20hazy)).  In the US, payers require prior authorization (high-risk patients only); in EU/JP, access is often limited to very high-risk/FH patients (post-price negotiations).  Icosapent (~\$4,300/yr), bempedoic acid (~\$4,200/yr US retail), and other novel agents are likewise on specialty tier.  Statin generics are widely covered by insurers.  Regional notes: NA accounts for largest share ([www.biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lipid-lowering-drugs-market-size-to-surpass-usd-46-58-bn-by-2033#:~:text=%C2%B7%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20North%20America%20dominated%20the,largest%20market%20share%20in%202024)); Europe and Japan adopt similar guidelines but manage price via HTA; China has its own approvals (e.g. ebronucimab for LDL) and evolving coverage.

**Overall Position & Outlook (Step 5):** We evaluated each asset’s competitive standing (evidence & differentiation) and assigned a category (Top/Mid/Niche/At-risk) and 1–3Y trajectory. Scores (0–100) and ranks are given below; key rationale: established therapies (statins, PCSK9s) score highest due to proven benefit and market share, while early/unknown pipelines score low. Pipeline outlook is uncertain (development risk, reimbursement).

*Evidence grade:*  We rate confidence as High (well‐established data, e.g. statins), Medium (some clinical data, e.g. ebronucimab, RN-0361 early Ph2), or Low (preclinical/first‐in-human stage). Unlicensed codes have “Low.” All positions and differentiators above are drawn from cited trials or guidelines; unknown assets are defaulted to low evidence.

**Part B: Evidence Appendix**  

- **Guidelines:** Statin-first strategy and lipid thresholds are codified in major guidelines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12690187/#:~:text=,1.8%20mmol%2FL%29.%20A)).  ACC/AHA/ADA/ESC updates (2023–25) stress LDL targets and add-on therapy (ezetimibe, PCSK9) when statin alone is insufficient ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=Statins%20remain%20the%20recommended%20first,Statin)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186865/#:~:text=)).  The 2025 ESC/EAS update elevated bempedoic acid recommendation (Class I for statin‐intolerant) ([www.escardio.org](https://www.escardio.org/communities/councils/cardiology-practice/education/cardiopractice/bempedoic-acid-mechanism-evidence-safety-and-guideline-role-in-2025/#:~:text=trial,intensity%20statin%20in%20those)).

- **Regulatory:** Drug labels and approvals confirm use: e.g. ebronucimab was NMPA-approved for primary and mixed hypercholesterolemia (AK102, 150mg Q2W) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12577479/#:~:text=randomized%20to%20receive%20ebronucimab%20450%E2%80%AFmg,%28Adjusted%20p%20%3C0.0001)); Xuezhikang was approved in China in the 1990s for dyslipidemia ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544391/#:~:text=Based%20on%20positive%20results%2C%20Xuezhikang,in%20China%2C%20patients%20with%20hyperlipidaemia)); inclisiran FDA‐approved 2021 (6mo dosing) (see FDA press releases).
